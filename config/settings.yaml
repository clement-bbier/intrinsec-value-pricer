# Default financial assumptions for the DCF model
# File last updated: 11/27/2025
# Note: these are base-case assumptions. Adapt with care depending on macro environment, interest rates, region, company profile, effective tax regime, etc.

risk_free_rate: 0.04          # 4.0% — baseline risk-free rate (e.g. long-term government bond yield). Should reflect current long-term sovereign yield.
market_risk_premium: 0.05     # 5.0% — equity risk premium assumption over risk-free. Varies with market conditions; choose based on historic data or consensus.
default_cost_of_debt: 0.05    # 5.0% — assumed cost of corporate debt. Should reflect the company’s credit quality, debt maturity, and current yield curve.
tax_rate: 0.25                # 25% — corporate tax rate assumption. Must be adapted to the actual statutory or effective tax rate depending on the firm and its jurisdiction.

fcf_growth_rate: 0.03         # 3.0% annual FCF growth — assumes stable, moderate growth. This assumption may be optimistic for very mature firms, or too conservative for high-growth firms.
perpetual_growth_rate: 0.02   # 2.0% terminal growth — assumes steady long-term growth, in line with long-term GDP + inflation expectations. Terminal growth should not exceed expected long-term economic growth.

default_projection_years: 5   # 5 years — standard explicit forecast horizon. May be extended (e.g. 7–10 years) for firms with longer-term growth visibility.

# UI defaults
default_ticker: "AAPL"        # Default ticker for UI (example)
price_history_period: "5y"    # Default price history period for UI — useful for volatility and trend analysis

# Important notes / limitations:
# - risk_free_rate must reflect current, relevant risk-free yield (e.g. a long-term sovereign bond). Otherwise, WACC/CAPM calculations will be biased.
# - market_risk_premium is subjective and varies over time; it should be updated to reflect current market conditions or historic return data.
# - cost_of_debt should depend on the company’s actual credit risk and prevailing interest rates; a flat assumption may mis-state cost of capital.
# - tax_rate must be adapted to the actual legal or effective corporate tax rate for the company under valuation.
# - fcf_growth_rate and perpetual_growth_rate are very sensitive: overly optimistic assumptions may inflate intrinsic value; overly conservative assumptions may undervalue potential growth.
# - projection horizon influences reliability: a too-short horizon may miss growth; a too-long horizon increases forecast uncertainty.
